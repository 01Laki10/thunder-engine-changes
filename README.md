<h2>How to use the Engine</h2>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

1. Get started with the [template](https://github.com/Thunder-Engine-Dev/te-template) to create a new repository for your game. Make sure to choose PRIVATE visibility if you don't want your game sources to be open for everyone.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Install [Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/) (regular edition).

<h3>Installation</h3>

1. Open a terminal or a command line in a directory where you want to store your project.<br/>
2. Clone your project template to your computer:

<code>git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-project-name --recursive</code><br/>
(Replace the github link there with your own github project repository link that you made in Preparation stage)<br/>

3. After cloning the project, navigate to it:

<code>cd your-project-name</code>

4. Update the engine:

<code>git submodule update --remote</code><br/>
- If it gives an error, then enter these commands one by one: <code>cd engine</code>, <code>git reset --hard</code>, <code>cd..</code>

5. Import the project to Godot Engine.
